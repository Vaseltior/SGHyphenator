SGHyphenator
============

SGHyphenator is a text hyphenation class for Objective-C.

## How to use it

Considering the word "attention", using an hyphenation system will return the following split :

* at
* ten
* tion

This means the word can be split like this *at-ten-tion*. So if the text is not justified, and the word reach the rightmost limit of the screen or the page so that it couldn't be drawn completely, you could give a try with the following words :

* at-
* atten-
* attention

Starting the new line with the remaining not used part of the word.
